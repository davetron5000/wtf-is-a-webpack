This site explains Webpack, but it also explains so much more.  It's a journey from nothing to developing, testing,
and deploying a basic website, all designed to minimally use tools in the horrendous JavaScript ecosystem.

I am not someone that accepts blobs of JSON as explanations for how things work.  I need to _really understand_ how
the tools I'm using work, and **why** we have to configure them the way we do.  The JavaScript ecosystem is rife
with Medium tutorials and out-of-date blog posts that assault you with giant blobs of JSON, filled with
unnecessary configuration options and requiting not-actually-required tools.

By the end of this mini-site/book/whatever, you *will* be using a fair number of tools, and your configuration will
be somewhat complex.  But, you'll know exactly why each tool was brought in and why each line of configuration had
to be written.  There will be very little handwaving.

This means deep-dives and sidetracks, but you'll learn a lot about why Webpack exists, what it's for and how it
interacts with the various its of the JavaScript ecosystem.

I've written this from my personal point of view, which is to say an experienced developer who is curious, can understand reasonable things, isn't an expert in the JavaScript ecosystem, but above-all wants a predictable, modern, proffesional, hassle-free developer experience, no matter what.

## What you Need

You just need a UNIX-like operating system where you can install basic software and run commands.  I'll tell you
what to install when, but I'm assuming you have a shell where you can do stuff like `mkdir` and `cat`, where you
have configured a text editor to write code, and where you can install software like Node.

## How to Read this

The book's code is executed as the book is published, so you should go through this and type what it says type,
write the code it says to write, and view things in the browser when told.  Even if early stuff feels remedial,
it's useful for your hands to type code, especially when you see the surprisingly small amount of configuration
you have to type for basic things.

OK, let's get to it!
